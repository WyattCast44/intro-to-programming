This problem contains the first version of the command line application (CLI) framework I am working on. It was the first draft of the framework and works well for this problem, but has several areas that have been improved in newer versions. I chose not to upgrade this problem to the latest version for time's sake and so that I can go back and look how I initially had things structured. 

It also uses several helper classes that I am still building out for my personal python library.
