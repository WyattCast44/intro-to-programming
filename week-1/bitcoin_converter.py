SWDV 600: INTRO TO PROGRAMMING

# Problem 

"""
Write a program that converts bitcoin to dollars (usd). At the end of this description you will find an example of the inputs and outputs for a correctly written program.

The program should begin by outputting to the user the date and time at which you recorded the conversion rate for bitcoins to usd. In the example below I went to Coinbase (Links to an external site.) on 8/1/17 at 11:13 am and found the price of a single bitcoin to be $2086 usd. I did not use any special Python libraries for concurrency conversion or dates nor should you.

After that output, the user should be prompted to input an amount of bitcoin they have. Notice in the example below the user's input value of .5. That value was typed in by the user as input, it is not a value printed out. We will use a convention of displaying user input in example interactions as bold text. Your program should allow the user to input any numeric value, not just .5. A user could enter .33 bitcoins, or 2.81 bitcoins.

Finally the program should output the value of the input amount in dollars based on that conversion rate. For example, if you find the conversion rate that 1 bitcoin is worth 2086 usd, then half a bitcoin, or .5 bitcoin, would be worth 1043 usd.

Here is an example interaction with a correctly written program:

As of 8/1/17 at 11:13 am, bitcoin is currently trading at $2086 per bitcoin.
Enter the bitcoin amount: .5
That is worth 1043 us dollars.
