# Maryville - SV600 - Intro to Programming Final Project

This is my submission for the final project, it is a classic text adventure game, called "The Adventures of Starman"

# The Adventures of Starman

The Adventures of Starman is a text adventure game, built in python.

# Questions

1. How many hours do you estimate you used completing this assignment?

I spent 12+ hours on thus assignment.

2. What was easiest for you when completing this assignment?

N/A

3. What was the most difficult challenge you experienced when completing this assignment?

This assignment was definitely the most challenging assignment yet. The nature of a text based adventure
game requires that a story be told. I struggled with this aspect the most, creating a cohesive and 
engaging story was extremely difficult for me. I rewrote the entire game several times and never really
got the story and flow the way I wanted. The technical side was not overly difficult, but the story 
did shape how the flow would have to be implemented, in the end I brute forced this story and implementation.

4. Are there any specific features or efforts you feel should be reviewed for possible extra credit?

I have been working on a command line interface framework called CLIFF the past couple of weeks and I am
fairly happy with how it has progressed. It is based on commands and options, and is very easy to create new applications.
It still has a fair bit to go before I would consider it ready for any type of real release, but I feel it 
has potential and shows a much deeper understanding of python and programming concepts than my end product for this adventure
game suggests. I've started a rewrite with a bit better separation of concerns and several performance optimizations, if you 
have any feedback on CLIFF that would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks for a great semester!
